4. Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (GEMM)

    Purpose: Key operation in transformer layers for attention mechanisms and MLP layers.
    Description: Multiply two dense matrices (e.g., attention weights and values).
    Kernel Implementation Focus:
        Leverage GPU libraries (e.g., cuBLAS, TensorRT) for optimal performance.
        Optimize communication for input/output matrices distributed across devices.
